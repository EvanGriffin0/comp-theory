    "\n",
    "This notebook is for the comp-theory module problems where I will document my progress .  \n",
    "Problem 1 focuses on implementing a set of 32-bit word operations used in the **Secure Hash Standard (SHA-256)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "These operations include logical functions such as `Ch`, `Maj`, and `Parity`, along with the rotation/shift functions  \n",
    "`Σ0`, `Σ1`, `σ0`, and `σ1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "All functions will be implemented in Python using **NumPy**, ensuring that all values behave as unsigned 32-bit integers  \n",
    "(`np.uint32`). Each function will include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a clear docstring  \n",
    "- a Markdown explanation  \n",
    "- correct 32-bit behaviour  \n",
    "- test examples verifying correctness  \n",
